**The Bank Management System**
 It is a Python-based project designed to simulate basic banking operations through a command-line interface. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as file handling, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) while providing users with essential banking functionalities.

Key Features:
Account Creation: Allows users to create new accounts by providing basic details like name, account type, and initial deposit.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Enables users to deposit money into or withdraw money from their accounts, updating the balance in real-time.
Account Information: Displays detailed account information, including the holderâ€™s name, account type, and current balance.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific accounts using unique account numbers.
File Handling: All account data is stored persistently in files, ensuring data remains accessible even after the program is closed.
Menu-Driven Interface: The system provides a simple menu-based navigation for ease of use.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Concepts: File handling, OOP, and basic algorithmic logic
Tools: Any Python IDE (e.g., VS Code) or terminal-based execution
Use Case:
This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of Python programming, especially for beginners interested in understanding how banking systems work at a basic level. It is also suitable for academic purposes, as a beginner project, or as a foundation for building more complex systems with GUIs or databases.
